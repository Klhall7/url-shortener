# URL Shortener Migration Environment

Generic Single-database configuration. This migration environment is set up to support a React project for a URL shortener application. The root directory url-shortener/ contains this api/ and the directory frontend/ which holds a Vite-React-Javascript project with react-router-dom implementation.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.12)
- PostgreSQL (version 16)
- Virtual Environment created and activated (env)
- WITHIN ACTIVE ENVIRONMENT, install libraries frozen in /requirements.txt

## Project Structure

- api/alembic: home directory of the Alembic migration environment

  - /versions: directory holds the individual version scripts.
  - /env.py: python script file with configurations and instructions for managing database migrations. This runs when whenever the alembic migration tool is invoked
  - /script.py.mako: Mako template file with script to control structure of each migration file generated within versions/.

- api/config.py: Configuration file for database connection.
- api/models.py: BaseModel definitions.
- api/db_connect.py: File for setting up the database engine and sessionmaker.
- api/main.py: the connection to FastAPI, established with CRUD Routes.

### Database Configuration

- PostgreSQL server is running and database 'url_shortener' set up.
- Git ignored `.env` file contains credentials for DATABASE_URL
- SQLAlchemy URL is read from the DATABASE_URL environment variable.
- database URL is defined in config.py and called in db_connect.py

### Test CRUD Routes

1. run fast FastApi:

- $ uvicorn main:app

2. test with Swagger documentation (SwaggerUI) at ('http://localhost:8000/docs')

### Running Migrations

To run migrations using Alembic:

- $ (env) alembic upgrade head
